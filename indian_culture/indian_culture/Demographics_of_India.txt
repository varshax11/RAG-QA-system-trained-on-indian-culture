India is the most populous country in the world with one-sixth of the world's population.
According to estimates from the United Nations (UN), India has overtaken China as the country with the largest population in the world, with a population of 1,425,775,850 at the end of April 2023.[12][13][14][15]

Between 1975 and 2010, the population doubled to 1.2 billion, reaching the billion mark in 2000. According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[15] In 2015, India's population was predicted to reach 1.7 billion by 2050.[16][17] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[18]

In 2023, the median age of an Indian was 29.5 years,[19] compared to 39.8 for China and 49.5 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[20] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[21]

India has many ethnic groups,[22] and every major region is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[23] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and between 25,000 and 70,000 people are  Siddhis,who are descendants of Bantu slaves brought by Arabs, Persians and Portuguese to the western coast of India during the  Middle Ages and the colonial period. They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[24]

The sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[25] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[26]

The following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820. It includes estimates and growth rates according to five economic historians, along with interpolated estimates and overall aggregate averages derived from their estimates.[27]

India's population has changed significantly due to migrations, technological advancements, and societal developments. Below is a table of historical population estimates:

Key Migration Periods & Population Impact

Neolithic Revolution (10,000 BC – 3000 BC)

Indo-Aryan Migration (2000 BC – 1500 BC)

Persian & Greek Influences (500 BC – 300 BC)

Islamic Invasions & Sultanates (1000 AD – 1500 AD)

Mughal Empire & Central Asian Influence (1500 AD – 1700 AD)

British Expansion & Demographic Shifts (1757 AD – 1800 AD)

The population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[47] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[29][31] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[29][31]

Under the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[47] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[48] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[49] and contemporary Europe[49] up until the 19th century.[50] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[49] and Paolo Malanima[50] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[51]

Under the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[52] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[53] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[49] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[49] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[54] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[55] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707).[52]

The total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire years. Sources: Our World in Data and Gapminder Foundation.[56]

Life expectancy from 1881 to 1950

The population of India under the British Raj (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) according to censuses:

Studies of India's population since 1881 have focused on such topics as total population, birth and death rates, geographic distribution, literacy, the rural and urban divide, cities of a million, and the three cities with populations over eight million: Delhi, Greater Mumbai (Bombay), and Kolkata (Calcutta).[61]

Mortality rates fell in the period 1920–45, primarily due to biological immunisation. Suggestions that it was the benefits of colonialism are refuted by academic thinking: "There can be no serious, informed belief... that... late colonial era mortality diminished and population grew rapidly because of improvements in income, living standards, nutrition, environmental standards, sanitation or health policies, nor was there a cultural transformation...".[62]

According to the 2001 census, 41.03% of the Indians spoke Hindi natively, while the rest spoke Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Maithili, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu and a variety of other languages. There are a total of 122 languages and 234 mother tongues spoken in India. Of these, 22 languages are specified in the Eighth Schedule of Indian Constitution, while 100 are non-specified.

Demographic and Health Surveys
From the Demographic Health Survey:[88]

Regional vital statistics

Neonatal and infant demographics

The table below represents the infant mortality rate trends in India, based on sex, over the last 15 years. In the urban areas of India, average male infant mortality rates are slightly higher than average female infant mortality rates.[92]

India's 2011 census shows a serious decline in the number of girls under the age of seven – activists posit that eight million female fetuses may have been aborted between 2001 and 2011.[98]

India occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population. At the 2001 census 72.2% of the population[100] lived in about 638,000 villages[101] and the remaining 27.8%[100] lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations.[102]
India's population exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people in 2010.[103] However, because Africa's population growth is extremely high compared to the rest of the world,[104][105] it is expected to surpass both China and India by the early 2030s.[106]

Caste and community statistics as recorded from "Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Commission" (SEBC) or Mandal Commission of 1979, which was completed in 1983.

India has chosen not to officially count caste population since then.

The following data are from the Mandal report:[citation needed]

The national Census of India does not recognise racial or ethnic groups within India,[145] but recognises many of the tribal groups as Scheduled Castes and Tribes (see list of Scheduled Tribes in India).
For a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries), see South Asian ethnic groups.


According to a 2009 study published by Reich et al.., the modern Indian population is composed of two genetically divergent and heterogeneous populations which mixed in ancient times (about 1,200–3,500 BP), known as Ancestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians (ASI). ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[148][149] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[150] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[151]

India is a country with a vast diversity of ethnic groups, each with its own distinct culture, language, and traditions. The major ethnic groups in India include the Indo-Aryans, Dravidians, Sino-Tibetans, Austroasiatic peoples, and various indigenous tribes. These groups are spread across different regions of India, each contributing to the country's rich cultural mosaic.

Y-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[153]

[154]

Mitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[155]

Numerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.
